üìì SQL Notes ‚Äì LeetCode #1661: Average Time of Process per Machine
‚úÖ Problem Statement (in your words)

Given a table Activity that records start and end timestamps of each process on each machine, calculate the average processing time per machine (i.e., end - start for each process, then average it for each machine_id).

    Each process is uniquely identified by a pair of:

        machine_id

        process_id
        ‚ûù Together, they form a composite key.

üìä Table Schema
Column	Type	Description
machine_id	int	ID of the machine
process_id	int	ID of the process
activity_type	enum	Either 'start' or 'end'
timestamp	float	Time when the activity happened (in sec)

    Each (machine_id, process_id) will have exactly 2 rows:
    ‚Üí One with 'start', one with 'end'

üß† Step-by-Step Logic (in simple words)

    Alias the table twice using JOIN:

        Activity a1: will store start rows

        Activity a2: will store end rows

    Join conditions:

        a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id

        a1.process_id = a2.process_id

        Ensure a1.activity_type = 'start' and a2.activity_type = 'end'
        ‚Üí This helps us correctly pair the start and end rows for each process.

    Calculate duration:
    ‚Üí a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp

    Use AVG() to calculate average duration per machine

    Use ROUND(..., 3) to round result to 3 decimal places

    Use GROUP BY to get one result per machine_id

üõ† Final SQL Query

SELECT 
  a1.machine_id,
  ROUND(AVG(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time
FROM Activity a1
JOIN Activity a2
  ON a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id 
  AND a1.process_id = a2.process_id
WHERE a1.activity_type = 'start'
  AND a2.activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY a1.machine_id;

üîÅ Example Walkthrough (Sample)
machine_id	process_id	activity_type	timestamp
0	0	start	0.712
0	0	end	1.520
0	1	start	3.140
0	1	end	4.120

Machine 0:

    Process 0: 1.520 - 0.712 = 0.808

    Process 1: 4.120 - 3.140 = 0.980

Average = (0.808 + 0.980) / 2 = 0.894

Final output for Machine 0:

| machine_id | processing_time |
|------------|-----------------|
|     0      |      0.894      |

üìù Key SQL Concepts Used
SQL Concept	Explanation
JOIN	To pair start and end rows from same process
WHERE	To filter rows: start from a1, end from a2
AVG()	To calculate average duration
ROUND(..., 3)	To round the result to 3 decimal places
GROUP BY	To group the result per machine
üîë Quick Recap Formula

SELECT machine_id, 
       ROUND(AVG(end_time - start_time), 3) 
FROM paired_start_end 
GROUP BY machine_id;

üß† Tip to Remember

If you're ever asked:

    ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the average time per group?‚Äù

You always need:

    GROUP BY

    AVG()

    JOIN (if data is in multiple rows like start/end)
