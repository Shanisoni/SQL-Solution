✅ SQL IN Operator – Simple Notes
📌 What is IN?

The IN operator is used to check if a value exists in a list.

It’s a shortcut for using multiple OR conditions.
📘 Syntax:

SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, value3, ...);

💡 Why use it?

To filter data where a column matches any value from a list.
🔹 Example 1: IN with values
👨‍🎓 Table: Students
id	name	grade
1	Ravi	A
2	Sita	B
3	Mohan	C
📌 Query:

SELECT name
FROM Students
WHERE grade IN ('A', 'B');

✅ Output:
name
Ravi
Sita
🔹 Example 2: IN with subquery
🧑‍💼 Table: Customers
customer_id	name	is_vip
1	Rohan	YES
2	Simran	NO
3	Priya	YES
📦 Table: Orders
order_id	customer_id	item
101	1	Laptop
102	2	USB Cable
103	3	Monitor
📌 Query:

SELECT item
FROM Orders
WHERE customer_id IN (
  SELECT customer_id FROM Customers WHERE is_vip = 'YES'
);

✅ Output:
item
Laptop
Monitor
🔄 NOT IN = Opposite of IN

SELECT name FROM Students
WHERE grade NOT IN ('C');

This will return students who did not get grade 'C'.
