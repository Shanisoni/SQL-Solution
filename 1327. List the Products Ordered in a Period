üìò SQL Note: Detailed Breakdown of the Query to Get Products with ‚â•100 Units Ordered in February 2020
‚úÖ Query:

SELECT A1.product_name, SUM(unit) AS unit
FROM Products AS A1
LEFT JOIN Orders AS A2 ON A1.product_id = A2.product_id
WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 2 AND YEAR(order_date) = 2020
GROUP BY A1.product_id
HAVING SUM(unit) >= 100;

üéØ Objective:

    Find all product names that had 100 or more units ordered in the month of February 2020, and return the total units sold during that time.

üîç Step-by-Step Explanation:
1Ô∏è‚É£ FROM Clause + Aliasing

FROM Products AS A1

    The query starts with the Products table.

    Alias A1 is used as a short reference for easier joins and readability.

2Ô∏è‚É£ LEFT JOIN Clause

LEFT JOIN Orders AS A2 ON A1.product_id = A2.product_id

    This performs a LEFT JOIN to bring in all rows from Products (A1) and any matching rows from Orders (A2) based on product_id.

    Even if no orders exist for a product, it still stays in the result (though we'll filter later).

üß† Note: In this context, INNER JOIN would also be valid and slightly more optimal, since WHERE filters out nulls anyway.
3Ô∏è‚É£ WHERE Clause: Filter for February 2020

WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 2 AND YEAR(order_date) = 2020

    Filters out orders that do not belong to February 2020.

    MONTH(order_date) = 2 selects rows where the order month is February.

    YEAR(order_date) = 2020 selects only orders from the year 2020.

üß† Tip: This is a readable and beginner-friendly way to filter by date. For performance, consider using:

WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2020-02-01' AND '2020-02-29'

4Ô∏è‚É£ GROUP BY Clause

GROUP BY A1.product_id

    After filtering, this clause groups the records by each product, using its unique product_id.

    This enables aggregation functions like SUM() to work per product.

5Ô∏è‚É£ SELECT Clause

SELECT A1.product_name, SUM(unit) AS unit

    From each product group, we:

        Extract product_name

        Compute the total units ordered via SUM(unit), aliased as unit

6Ô∏è‚É£ HAVING Clause

HAVING SUM(unit) >= 100

    Unlike WHERE, which filters rows before grouping, HAVING filters after aggregation.

    This keeps only products whose total ordered units ‚â• 100.

‚úÖ Final Output:

Returns a table:
product_name	unit

üß† Key Concepts Demonstrated in Your Query:
Concept	Used In
Table Aliasing	AS A1, AS A2
Joins	LEFT JOIN to combine tables
Date filtering	MONTH(), YEAR() in WHERE clause
Grouping	GROUP BY for aggregation
Aggregation	SUM(unit) to compute total units
Post-aggregation filter	HAVING to keep results with unit ‚â• 100
üöÄ Optimization Tip (Optional for Advanced Use)

If you‚Äôre 100% sure that you only care about orders in Feb 2020, and you don't want products with no sales to appear at all:
üîÅ Replace LEFT JOIN with INNER JOIN ‚Äî it's faster:

FROM Products AS A1
INNER JOIN Orders AS A2 ON A1.product_id = A2.product_id

‚úÖ Verdict:

Your query is correct, efficient, and shows strong understanding of:

    joins

    date filtering

    grouping and aggregation

    post-aggregation filtering

This is exactly how we write clear, maintainable analytical SQL in real-world scenarios.
