# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT CASE 
WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id - 1
WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id
ELSE id + 1 END AS id , student 
FROM Seat 
ORDER BY id




Got it bro. Let's fix that — here's a 1000x cleaner and sharper explanation, breaking every single piece of this query down with real data, line-by-line logic, and visual mapping.
🧾 QUERY:

SELECT
  CASE 
    WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id - 1
    WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id
    ELSE id + 1
  END AS id,
  student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id;

👀 INPUT TABLE: Seat
id	student
1	Abbot
2	Doris
3	Emerson
4	Green
5	Jeames
🔍 GOAL:

    Swap every two consecutive students.

    If total number is odd, last student stays in place.

🧠 QUERY BREAKDOWN (Every Line + Why It Exists)
🔹 Line 1: SELECT

We are selecting:

    A new seat ID (not the same as table) using a CASE.

    The student name.

🔹 Line 2–6: CASE Logic

Let’s simulate it row-by-row:
🧪 1st row: id = 1 (Abbot)

    Is 1 even? ❌

    Is 1 the last id? ❌ (MAX(id) = 5)
    ✅ So go to ELSE → id + 1 = 2
    ➡️ Abbot → id 2

🧪 2nd row: id = 2 (Doris)

    Is 2 even? ✅
    ➡️ THEN id - 1 = 1
    ➡️ Doris → id 1

🧪 3rd row: id = 3 (Emerson)

    Is 3 even? ❌

    Is 3 last id? ❌
    ➡️ ELSE id + 1 = 4
    ➡️ Emerson → id 4

🧪 4th row: id = 4 (Green)

    Is 4 even? ✅
    ➡️ THEN id - 1 = 3
    ➡️ Green → id 3

🧪 5th row: id = 5 (Jeames)

    Is 5 even? ❌

    Is 5 = MAX(id)? ✅
    ➡️ THEN id = 5
    ➡️ Jeames stays at id 5

🔁 Output Before ORDER:
new_id	student
2	Abbot
1	Doris
4	Emerson
3	Green
5	Jeames
🔹 Last Line: ORDER BY id

Now we sort it by the new id, so the students appear in their new positions:
id	student
1	Doris
2	Abbot
3	Green
4	Emerson
5	Jeames
🎯 VISUAL MAPPING

Before:

ID:     1      2      3      4      5
Seat:  Abbot  Doris  Emerson Green  Jeames

After Swapping:

ID:     1      2      3      4      5
Seat:  Doris  Abbot  Green  Emerson Jeames

🧠 Why This Works
Condition	What It Does
id % 2 = 0	Even → go back (swap left)
id % 2 = 1 AND id = MAX(id)	Last odd → stay as is
ELSE	Odd → go forward (swap right)
💥 Final Answer
id	student
1	Doris
2	Abbot
3	Green
4	Emerson
5	Jeames

Let me know if you want the JOIN version, a version with more rows, or animated visual logic bro — I got you 💯.

still not understood , give like even odd and normalvin detail

No worries bro — let’s go ultra-basic and crystal clear, breaking this SQL query down using only three categories:
👉 Even IDs
👉 Odd IDs (Normal)
👉 Odd IDs (Last One)

This will be super simple, like real-life logic — not SQL-like, just logic-like — then we’ll map that back to the query. Ready? Let’s go step by step 🚀
🧾 Sample Input Table
id	student
1	Abbot
2	Doris
3	Emerson
4	Green
5	Jeames
🧠 What the SQL Code Does in Human Words
👇 It checks each row like this:
✅ 1. If the id is even (like 2, 4, 6...)

👉 Swap it with the previous seat (i.e., id - 1)
Example:

    id = 2 → go back to id = 1

    id = 4 → go back to id = 3

🧠 Why? Because even-numbered students go to the left.
✅ 2. If the id is odd AND it is the last student (highest id)

👉 Don't move! Just stay where you are.
Example:

    If total 5 students, then id = 5 is the last → Jeames stays at 5

🧠 Why? Because there's no one to your right to swap with.
✅ 3. If the id is odd and NOT the last

👉 Swap it with the next seat (i.e., id + 1)
Example:

    id = 1 → go forward to id = 2

    id = 3 → go forward to id = 4

🧠 Why? Because odd-numbered students (except the last) go to the right.
🧠 Now Let’s Label Each Row
id	student	Is Even?	Is Last?	Action	Goes to id
1	Abbot	❌ Odd	❌ No	Go to right	2
2	Doris	✅ Yes	❌ No	Go to left	1
3	Emerson	❌ Odd	❌ No	Go to right	4
4	Green	✅ Yes	❌ No	Go to left	3
5	Jeames	❌ Odd	✅ Yes	Stay	5
🧾 Output Before Sorting:
id	student
2	Abbot
1	Doris
4	Emerson
3	Green
5	Jeames

Now we sort it by id using ORDER BY id to make it clean and in seat order.
✅ Final Output (Swapped View)
id	student
1	Doris
2	Abbot
3	Green
4	Emerson
5	Jeames
🔁 Recap in Simple Language:
Type	Condition	Action
Even	id % 2 = 0	Go to previous (id - 1)
Odd & Last	id = MAX(id)	Stay as is
Odd & Not Last	id % 2 = 1 AND not last	Go to next (id + 1)

Let me know if you want to try with 6 students or want me to turn this into a picture too!
