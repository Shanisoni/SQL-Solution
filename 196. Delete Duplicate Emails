Absolutely Shani! Let's walk through your DELETE query in ultra-detailed steps, including:

    Input table

    Step-by-step execution of each part of the query

    Final output table after deletion

üßæ Initial Table: Person
id	email
1	john@example.com
2	bob@example.com
3	john@example.com
4	alice@example.com
5	john@example.com
6	bob@example.com
üß† Query:

DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id)
    FROM (SELECT * FROM Person) AS p
    GROUP BY email
);

üß© Step-by-step Breakdown:
üîπ Step 1: SELECT * FROM Person

Just retrieves all rows from the table:

id | email
---|-------------------
1  | john@example.com
2  | bob@example.com
3  | john@example.com
4  | alice@example.com
5  | john@example.com
6  | bob@example.com

üîπ Step 2: Wrapping it inside:

FROM (SELECT * FROM Person) AS p

This is required in MySQL so we can select from Person while also deleting from it. It acts like a temporary view named p.
üîπ Step 3: Grouping & selecting MIN(id):

SELECT MIN(id)
FROM (SELECT * FROM Person) AS p
GROUP BY email

This groups rows by email and returns the smallest id for each group.
üëá Output of this subquery:
MIN(id)	email
1	john@example.com
2	bob@example.com
4	alice@example.com

So this subquery returns:

(1, 2, 4)

These are the first occurrence IDs for each unique email.
üîπ Step 4: Outer DELETE:

DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (1, 2, 4);

Now, we delete all rows whose id is NOT in (1, 2, 4).

So rows with these IDs will be deleted:

    id = 3 (john@example.com) ‚úÖ delete

    id = 5 (john@example.com) ‚úÖ delete

    id = 6 (bob@example.com) ‚úÖ delete

‚úÖ Final Output Table (Person after deletion):
id	email
1	john@example.com
2	bob@example.com
4	alice@example.com

üéØ All duplicates are removed. Only one row per unique email remains, and it's always the smallest id.
üîÅ Summary of Query Logic:
Step	Action	Result
1	Select all rows	All rows from Person
2	Group by email, get MIN(id)	(1, 2, 4)
3	Delete where id is not in (1, 2, 4)	Delete rows 3, 5, 6
4	Final table contains only unique emails	‚úÖ Success
