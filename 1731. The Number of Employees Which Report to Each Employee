SELECT A1.employee_id , A1.name , COUNT(A2.reports_to) AS reports_count, ROUND(AVG(A2.age)) AS average_age
FROM Employees AS A1
JOIN Employees AS A2 ON
A1.employee_id = A2.reports_to 
GROUP BY A1.employee_id , A1.name
ORDER BY employee_id


🔄 Problem Recap

We’re given a table Employees:
employee_id	name	reports_to	age
1	Michael	NULL	45
2	Alice	1	38
3	Bob	1	42
4	Charlie	2	34
5	David	2	40
6	Eve	3	37

We need to:

    Identify managers (those who have direct reports),

    Return:

        their employee_id

        their name

        count of direct reports

        average age of those reports (rounded)

    Sort by manager ID

Now let’s break your query line by line:
✅ Full Query:

SELECT 
  A1.employee_id, 
  A1.name, 
  COUNT(A2.reports_to) AS reports_count, 
  ROUND(AVG(A2.age)) AS average_age
FROM Employees AS A1
JOIN Employees AS A2 
  ON A1.employee_id = A2.reports_to
GROUP BY A1.employee_id, A1.name
ORDER BY employee_id;

🚀 FLOW-WISE + WORD-BY-WORD EXPLANATION
🔹 SELECT

    This tells SQL what columns to show in the final result.

🔹 A1.employee_id

    Select the ID of the manager.

    A1 is an alias for the first copy of the table (manager side).

    This uniquely identifies the manager.

🔹 A1.name

    Select the name of the manager.

    Again from alias A1, because this is the manager's data.

🔹 COUNT(A2.reports_to) AS reports_count

    Counts how many employees report to this manager.

    A2 is the second alias (employee side).

    A2.reports_to contains the employee_id of the manager.

    So counting A2.reports_to gives you how many times A1 appears as a manager.

📌 This is required to answer: "how many employees report to each manager?"
🔹 ROUND(AVG(A2.age)) AS average_age

    This calculates:

    The average age of all employees (A2) reporting to a manager (A1).

    AVG() → computes the average

    ROUND() → rounds it to the nearest integer (as required)

📌 This is required to answer: "what is the average age of each manager's team?"
🔹 FROM Employees AS A1

    We start with the Employees table and give it an alias A1.

📌 A1 is used to represent managers.
🔹 JOIN Employees AS A2

    We join the same table again and alias it as A2.

📌 A2 represents employees who report to a manager.
🔹 ON A1.employee_id = A2.reports_to

    This is the self-join condition.

Meaning:

    For every employee A2, we look at their reports_to column (which is a manager's ID).

    We match it to the employee_id of someone in A1.

📌 This creates a row for every (manager, employee) pair.
🔹 GROUP BY A1.employee_id, A1.name

    This groups all (manager, employee) pairs by manager.

📌 Now for each manager, we can:

    Count their employees

    Average their ages

🔹 ORDER BY employee_id

    Sorts the final output in ascending order of manager IDs.

✅ Final output will be clean and in correct order.
🔄 VISUAL FLOW

Here's how it works step by step:
✅ Step 1: Self-Join

Each employee (A2) gets joined with their manager (A1).

🔁 Matches like:
A1.employee_id (Manager)	A1.name	A2.employee_id	A2.name	A2.age
1	Michael	2	Alice	38
1	Michael	3	Bob	42
2	Alice	4	Charlie	34
2	Alice	5	David	40
3	Bob	6	Eve	37
✅ Step 2: Grouping

Group the above table by A1 (manager), then:

    COUNT how many rows per group = reports_count

    AVG the A2.age values = average_age

✅ Step 3: Output
employee_id	name	reports_count	average_age
1	Michael	2	40
2	Alice	2	37
3	Bob	1	37
