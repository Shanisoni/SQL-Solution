✅ Query:

SELECT user_id , 
       CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(name , 1)), LOWER(RIGHT(name, LENGTH(name) - 1))) AS name
FROM Users
ORDER BY user_id;

🎯 Purpose of This Query:

To return a list of all users with:

    their original user_id

    their name properly capitalized:
    → First letter uppercase, rest lowercase

✅ Step-by-Step Breakdown
🔹 SELECT clause:

SELECT user_id ,
       CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(name , 1)), LOWER(RIGHT(name, LENGTH(name) - 1))) AS name

This tells the SQL engine:

    I want to display two columns:

        user_id (as-is)

        a computed column name, where I apply formatting functions to the original name column

Let’s understand each function inside the CONCAT(...) step by step 👇
🔸 1. CONCAT(...)

Purpose: Joins multiple strings together into one final string.
✅ Syntax:

CONCAT(string1, string2, ..., stringN)

💡 Use Case:

When you want to build one string from parts. Here, we want:

    First character as uppercase

    Remaining characters as lowercase

👉 Example:

CONCAT('J', 'ohn') → 'John'

🔸 2. LEFT(name, 1)

Purpose: Extracts the first N characters from the beginning of the string.
✅ Syntax:

LEFT(string, number_of_characters)

💡 In this query:

LEFT(name, 1)

    name → the original column containing the name (e.g., 'sHaNi')

    1 → number of characters to take from the left

    So: LEFT('sHaNi', 1) → 's'

📌 We want the first character so we can convert it to uppercase.
🔸 3. UPPER(...)

Purpose: Converts the entire string passed to it into uppercase.
✅ Syntax:

UPPER(string)

💡 In this query:

UPPER(LEFT(name, 1))

    Takes 's' → becomes 'S'

So now you’ve processed:

    First letter only → LEFT(name, 1)

    Made it uppercase → UPPER(...)

🔸 4. LENGTH(name)

Purpose: Returns the number of characters in the string.
✅ Syntax:

LENGTH(string)

💡 In this query:

LENGTH(name) - 1

    Suppose name = 'sHaNi'

    LENGTH(name) → 5

    Subtract 1 → 4 (we are skipping the first letter)

📌 Used to determine how many characters are after the first one.
🔸 5. RIGHT(name, LENGTH(name) - 1)

Purpose: Extracts the last N characters from a string.
✅ Syntax:

RIGHT(string, number_of_characters)

💡 In this query:

RIGHT(name, LENGTH(name) - 1)

If name = 'sHaNi':

    LENGTH(name) = 5

    RIGHT(name, 4) → 'HaNi'

📌 This gets the rest of the name (excluding the first letter).
🔸 6. LOWER(...)

Purpose: Converts the input string to lowercase.
✅ Syntax:

LOWER(string)

💡 In this query:

LOWER(RIGHT(name, LENGTH(name) - 1))

    Takes 'HaNi' → becomes 'hani'

📌 Makes rest of the name lowercase to ensure consistent formatting.
✅ Bringing it all together:

CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(name , 1)), LOWER(RIGHT(name, LENGTH(name) - 1)))

With name = 'sHaNi':

    First letter → LEFT(name, 1) = 's' → UPPER() → 'S'

    Remaining → RIGHT(name, 4) = 'HaNi' → LOWER() → 'hani'

    Final → 'S' + 'hani' = 'Shani'

🔹 AS name

This is an alias. It renames the output column to name.

So your final result will be:

user_id | name
--------|-------
1       | Shani

🔹 FROM Users

Specifies the table you are querying from.

    Users is the table that contains:

        user_id

        name

🔹 ORDER BY user_id

Sorts the final results by user_id in ascending order.

If your table has:

user_id | name
--------|-------
3       | sHaNi
1       | rAhUl
2       | gARy

Your result will be:

user_id | name
--------|-------
1       | Rahul
2       | Gary
3       | Shani

✅ Final Output Example

Given table:

user_id | name
--------|--------
1       | jOhN
2       | sHaNi
3       | aLICE

After running your query:

user_id | name
--------|-------
1       | John
2       | Shani
3       | Alice

🔁 Summary of Functions Used
Function	Purpose	Example Input	Output
LEFT()	First N chars	'sHaNi', 1	's'
RIGHT()	Last N chars	'sHaNi', 4	'HaNi'
LENGTH()	Length of string	'sHaNi'	5
UPPER()	Make string uppercase	's'	'S'
LOWER()	Make string lowercase	'HaNi'	'hani'
CONCAT()	Merge two strings	'S' + 'hani'	'Shani'

If you'd like, I can give a version of this query that updates the original table, or works with full names with spaces ("john DOE" → "John Doe"), just let me know bro 🔥
