✅ THE FULL QUERY

SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    country,
    COUNT(*) AS trans_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_count,
    SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount
FROM 
    Transactions
GROUP BY 
    month, country;

🔍 1. SELECT

The SELECT clause is used to specify which columns or computed values you want in the output.

Everything in this block is about what you want to see in your result table.
🔍 2. DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS month
✅ What it does:

    Converts a full date (like 2025-07-03) into a year-month format (2025-07).

    Useful for monthly reports or grouping transactions by month.

📘 Example:
trans_date	Result of DATE_FORMAT
2025-07-03	2025-07
2025-07-27	2025-07
2025-06-15	2025-06

Now both 3rd July and 27th July will be grouped together under 2025-07.
🔍 3. country

Just selecting the country column from the table.

    This assumes each transaction has a country field like 'India', 'USA', 'UK', etc.

    We'll group data per month and country combo.

🔍 4. COUNT(*) AS trans_count
✅ What it does:

    Counts the total number of rows (transactions) per group.

    COUNT(*) counts all rows — including NULLs — because it just checks row presence.

📘 Example:
trans_date	country	state	amount
2025-07-01	India	approved	100
2025-07-02	India	declined	50
2025-07-03	India	approved	200

    COUNT(*) = 3 (3 total transactions for India in July)

🔍 5. SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_count
✅ What it does:

    Counts only the approved transactions.

    It uses a CASE WHEN statement inside SUM().

🧠 Explanation:

    CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END evaluates to 1 if approved, else 0.

    SUM(...) adds up all the 1s → giving us the total number of approved transactions.

📘 Example:
state	CASE WHEN...	SUM
approved	1	1
declined	0	0
approved	1	1
Total → 2 approved		
🔍 6. SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount
✅ What it does:

    Sums up the amount for all transactions, whether approved or declined.

📘 Example:
amount
100
50
200
Total = 100 + 50 + 200 = 350
🔍 7. SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount
✅ What it does:

    Sums up the amount only where the state is 'approved'.

    Same technique as before, but with amount this time.

🧠 Explanation:

    If a row is approved, use its amount.

    Else, use 0 (which doesn’t affect the sum).

    SUM(...) totals just the approved transaction amounts.

📘 Example:
state	amount	CASE WHEN...
approved	100	100
declined	50	0
approved	200	200
Total = 100 + 200 = 300		
🔍 8. FROM Transactions

The table from which all this data is fetched.

Assumes the schema looks like:

CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    trans_id INT,
    trans_date DATE,
    country VARCHAR(50),
    state VARCHAR(10),      -- 'approved', 'declined', etc.
    amount INT
);

🔍 9. GROUP BY month, country

This line groups all rows that have the same month and country.

    This means, the aggregates (SUM, COUNT, etc.) will be calculated per group.

📘 Example:
trans_date	country	amount	state
2025-07-01	India	100	approved
2025-07-02	India	200	approved
2025-07-03	USA	50	declined
2025-07-10	India	150	declined

👉 These rows will be grouped as:

    2025-07 | India → 3 transactions

    2025-07 | USA → 1 transaction

🎯 Final Output Example:
month	country	trans_count	approved_count	trans_total_amount	approved_total_amount
2025-07	India	3	2	450	300
2025-07	USA	1	0	50	0
🧠 KEY CONCEPTS USED
Concept	What it does
DATE_FORMAT()	Extracts and formats parts of a date
COUNT(*)	Counts total rows per group
SUM(CASE WHEN ...)	Conditionally aggregates data
GROUP BY	Divides data into logical groups
AS	Renames the column in output
ROUND(..., 2)	Rounds numbers to 2 decimal places
🔍 WHY THIS QUERY IS SO POWERFUL

    Combines date formatting + grouping + conditional logic.

    Helps you generate a monthly country-wise transaction report.

    Shows both count of transactions and actual money movement.

🧪 If You Wanted Even More Insights...

Here’s how you could extend it:

    Add declined counts:

SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'declined' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS declined_count

    Add declined total amounts:

SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'declined' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS declined_total_amount

💡 TL;DR Summary
Line	Purpose
DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m')	Groups data by month
country	Filters and groups by country
COUNT(*)	Counts all transactions
SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)	Counts only approved transactions
SUM(amount)	Adds all transaction amounts
SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END)	Adds approved amounts only
GROUP BY	Ensures aggregation is per month and country
